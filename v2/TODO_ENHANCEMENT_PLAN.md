## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Start with Phase 1.1 (Meaningful Phase Initialization)

**Why this first:** This is the foundation that will make all other improvements effective. Without meaningful phases, the quantum mechanics won't work properly.

**Expected Impact:**

- Better text generation quality
- More coherent phase relationships
- Foundation for all other quantum improvements

### Step 2: Implement Phase 1.2 (Global Interference Layer)

**Why this second:** This adds the missing quantum component that makes the model truly quantum-inspired.

**Expected Impact:**

- Non-local token interactions
- Better long-range dependencies
- More sophisticated interference patterns

### Step 3: Enhance Phase 1.3 (Energy Functions)

**Why this third:** This will make the training align with quantum principles.

**Expected Impact:**

- Better training convergence
- More meaningful loss functions
- Improved model performance

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Perplexity improvement by 20%+
- [ ] Generated text coherence improvement
- [ ] Phase coherence metrics showing meaningful relationships
- [ ] Memory efficiency maintained for RTX 4090
- [ ] Training stability and convergence

## Notes

- Each phase should be implemented and tested independently
- Start with small model sizes for testing
- Monitor memory usage carefully
- Validate each improvement with generation tests
- Keep the consumer GPU (RTX 4090) constraints in mind

## Current Model Parameters

- Model Dim: 512
- Layers: 8
- Heads: 8
- Phase Dim: 64
- Seq Length: 512
- Batch Size: 4
- Learning Rate: 3e-4

## Next Action

**START WITH: Phase 1.1 - Meaningful Phase Initialization**
This will provide the foundation for all other improvements and should show immediate benefits in generation quality.

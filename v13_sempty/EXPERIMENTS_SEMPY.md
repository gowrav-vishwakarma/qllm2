# v13_sempty — the simple PAM, in words

This is the experiment file for `v13_sempty`: what the model is, what was
deliberately left out and why, and what we plan to measure. The code in
`model.py` is written to be read the way this file is written — the same
words.

## The model, in one paragraph

Each layer owns one notebook per head: a complex d×d matrix. Every token does
three things to it, in this order:

```
notebook_t = decay_t · notebook_{t-1} + value_t ⊗ conj(key_t)
read_t     = d^(-1/2) · (notebook_t · query_t)
```

1. **Fade.** Multiply the notebook by `decay_t`, a learned number in (0, 1).
   One number per head, read off the token:
   `decay_t = exp(−softplus(W·[Re h_t, Im h_t] + b))`. This is the *only*
   learned knob on the memory.
2. **Write.** Add one new association: the token's value hung on the phase of
   its key. The write is conjugate, so a later query with the same phase
   recalls the value exactly — this is why the model is called *phase*-
   associative.
3. **Read.** Probe the notebook with the query (raw complex dot, no
   conjugate on the query), scaled by `d^(−1/2)`.

The read happens *after* the write, so a token can read what it just wrote.

Between layers sits a complex gated channel mix (CGU) with pre-norm residual:
`x = x + cgu_scale · CGU(x)`, then `x = x + pam_scale · PAM(x)`, with
`cgu_scale = 1.0`, `pam_scale = 0.1` (the v11 bare-minimum geometry). Input is
a complex embedding; output is a *tied* complex head (the embedding matrix,
split real/imag, is the score table).

## The recurrence, and why there are two paths

The notebook is a running state: `S_t = γ_t S_{t-1} + u_t`, with
`γ_t = decay_t` and `u_t = value_t ⊗ conj(key_t)`. This is the standard
"multiply-old, add-new" recurrence. Two facts make it cheap.

**Closed form inside a window.** If `a_s = γ_s · … · γ_1` is the product of
decays up to position s, then by induction

```
S_s = a_s · ( S_0 + Σ_{j ≤ s} u_j / a_j )
```

Proof: multiply the step `S_s = γ_s S_{s-1} + u_s` through by `a_s` to get
`a_s S_s = a_{s-1} S_{s-1} + a_s u_s`, and the induction hypothesis supplies
`a_{s-1} S_{s-1}`. (Verified numerically: stepwise vs closed form agree to
8.9e-16 in fp32 on a 50-step random recurrence.) So a window of C tokens is
**one** cumulative product (`a_s`) and **one** cumulative sum (`Σ u_j / a_j`)
— O(C) work, never O(C²), and the notebook at the last position of the window
(`select(window_notebook, over=chunk_time, index=C-1)`) is carried into the
next. Training and prefill process the sequence in windows of `chunk_size`
(256 by default).

**One step per token at decode.** The same recurrence, applied once per new
token on the carried notebook: O(1) per token, independent of context length.

The two paths run *the same algebra*, so they must agree. They do, measured
in `selftest.py::test_parallel_vs_recurrent` on CPU fp32 with a deliberately
small chunk (17 tokens = 7 + 7 + 3 windows):

- max |logit diff| = **2.98e-07**
- max |carried-notebook diff| = **1.86e-08**

**Pre-registered equivalence contract:** the chunked path and the stepwise
path agree on logits and on carried notebooks to ≤ 1e-4 on CPU fp32 (fp32
round-off is ~1e-7; the bar is 100× looser on purpose so the test fails on a
real algebra bug, not on a reordering).

## What was deliberately left out, and why

This is a *lean* model by decision, not by accident. Every item below was in
v7/v11/v13 at some point and was cut because it either measured neutral or
bought a sub-point of PPL at real compute cost.

### Position: RoPE in, learned positions out

**Question:** does the recurrence need positional embeddings at all? The
recurrence alone only knows *recency* — a decaying number. Word order needs a
position carrier.

**Evidence from the old logs** (v7 7pos ablation, WikiText-103, ~100M,
matched B=18 recipe, `logs/v7/exp7pos_*_20260520_124e34e_dirty/`):

| Run | learned pos at input | RoPE on Q/K | Val PPL @10e | vs RoPE-only |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 7d-control | no | yes | **26.88** | — |
| 7pos-hybrid | yes | yes | **26.92** | **+0.04** (worse, +0.8M params) |
| 7pos-only | yes | no | **26.72** | −0.16 (confounded: +0.8M params, no RoPE) |

Learned input positions measured **neutral-to-negative**: +0.04 PPL when
added to RoPE, and the "pos-only" win (−0.16) is confounded by the extra
parameters and by removing RoPE — not a clean win. v11 independently rejected
learned input positions.

**Decision:** RoPE on Q/K (a buffer + one complex multiply, zero parameters),
no learned input positions. If a future experiment shows the recurrence
itself is position-blind in a way that hurts generation, that is the first
thing to revisit — with a clean ablation, not a confounded one.

### The v13 machinery: all out

The v13 "selective" PAM had, on top of this recurrence: a GSP protect gate,
a vault (extra protected state), a delta-rule write with an erase gate,
E3 phase routing (state competition, `state_compete`, `phase_proj`),
write-phase addressing, per-channel decay, qk-norm, n-gram features,
`gamma_floor`, and a gate-surprisal auxiliary loss.

**Decision: all of it out.** The sROI rule below is the standing test, and
none of these mechanisms has cleared it in a clean ablation. The lean model
is the floor; any mechanism that comes back must first beat the floor by
more than noise.

### What stays (the v11 bare minimum)

Kept because it is either the model's identity or was measured to matter:

- **Complex** everything (embedding, PAM, head). "Phase-associative" *is*
  the complex conjugate-write / raw-read.
- **CGU** before PAM in each block (~2.4 PPL worth in v7 lean L1).
- **Tied complex head.**
- **RoPE** (above).
- **Pre-norm residual** with `pam_scale = 0.1`.
- **Fused QKV** (one projection, split by name).
- **Chunked closed-form training** + **stepwise decode** (above).

## The sROI rule (standing principle)

> **Reject any mechanism that buys a sub-point (0.xx) of PPL at meaningful
> compute cost.**

"Meaningful" = extra kernels, extra state, extra memory traffic, or extra
parameters that a lean run must then carry forever. Sub-point PPL at that
price is noise, not signal: the old logs show 0.04–0.58 PPL differences
flipping with commit, batch, and logging. A mechanism earns its keep by
clearing the noise floor, not by sitting inside it.

This is why "pure PAM" is not a style choice — it is the only design that
has passed the sROI test so far.

## Layout: named end to end

The whole point of `v13_sempty` is that the code *is* the math. Every axis is
a named `Dim`; layout changes are `.to()` / `.alias()`; matrix products are
`contract` / `outer`; the complex pair is a policy, not a bookkeeping axis.
`check_torch_layout.py` fails the build if anything reaches for `view`,
`permute`, `[..., 0]`, a numeric `dim=`, or escapes to `.raw` / `.data`
outside a declared boundary.

| Axis | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `batch` | sequence items in the minibatch |
| `time` | token positions |
| `model_dim` | residual / embedding width |
| `heads` | PAM heads |
| `head_feature` | per-head channel width (d) |
| `complex_pair` | last axis of size 2: real then imag |
| `qkv_slot` / `qkv_fused` | the fused Q/K/V packing (slot 0=q, 1=k, 2=v) |
| `head_row` / `head_col` | the two axes of the d×d notebook |
| `chunk_time` | token positions inside one window |
| `real_imag_feature` | `concat(real, imag)` along `model_dim` |

**Declared raw-torch boundaries** (the only places raw torch is legal):

| Site | Why it stays raw |
|------|------------------|
| `complex_ops.build_rope_cache` | position table built once, outside the graph |
| `LM.generate` | sampling loop over raw logits |
| `LM.ce_from_lm` hand-off | chunked CE must not materialize `[N, vocab]` |
| `fused_ce.py` | custom autograd Function (whole module is a boundary) |
| `selftest.py` | compares against plain `F.cross_entropy` |
| `train.py` / `generate.py` | optimiser / dataloader / sampling plumbing |

### torch → sempyt mapping (folded from the old SEMPYT_OPS.md)

| Old torch pattern | sempyt replacement |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `x.view(B,T,H,d)` / `x.permute(…)` | `x.to(batch, time, heads, head_feature)` |
| `a @ b` (real or complex) | `contract(a, b, over=shared_axis)` |
| `outer(v, k)` | `outer(v, k.conj(), over=(head_row, head_col))` |
| `real/imag` via `[...,0]` | `real(z)`, `imag(z)` |
| `torch.stack([r,i],-1)` | `as_complex(r, i, complex_pair)` |
| broadcast via `unsqueeze` | `x * y` (missing axes broadcast as size-1) |
| `x.sum(dim=…)` over an axis | `sum(x, over=that_axis)` |
| `x[:, :, a:b]` chunk slice | `take(x, over=time, start=a, length=C, new=chunk_time)` |
| `torch.cat(chunks, dim=…)` | `cat(chunks, over="chunk_time", into=time)` |
| `select(x, dim, i)` | `select(x, over=that_axis, index=i)` |
| `torch.cumprod(…, dim=-1)` | `cumprod(x, over=time)` |
| RoPE on Q, K | `q * rope_named`, `k * rope_named` |
| `torch.zeros(d1,d2,…,2)` | `zeros(d1, d2, …, complex_pair, policy=…)` |

## Experiment ledger

The baseline is set; no GPU experiment has been run yet. Entries below are
pre-registered, not results.

| # | Question | Design | Bar to pass | Status |
|---|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| — | baseline | — | — | **clean baseline, PPL regression vs v13 accepted** |
| 1 | *Does the simple PAM learn anything at all on real data?* | `baseline` preset (384/6/64/16, v11 7d geometry), WikiText-103, B=18, 10e, RoPE on, `chunk_size=256` | finite loss, loss decreases, PPL logged for the record | **not started — needs user go-ahead to launch on GPU** |
| 2 | *Is the recurrence actually position-blind, and does it matter?* | generation quality probe on run 1 (rep3/rep4/uniq) | if degenerate, revisit position (clean ablation) | not started (depends on 1) |

**Rules for this ledger:**
- One variable per row. No confounded runs.
- A row only "passes" if it clears the sROI rule *and* the pre-registered bar.
- Negative results are written down and closed, same as positive ones.

## Verification status (CPU, 2026-08-29)

Measured with `.venv/bin/python -m v13_sempty.selftest` on CPU fp32:

- `test_param_count_and_state` — **PASS** (tiny preset = 6,606,540 params;
  `rope_cache` correctly *not* in state_dict)
- `test_parallel_vs_recurrent` — **PASS** (2.98e-07 logits, 1.86e-08 states)
- `test_tied_logits` — **PASS** (4.77e-07 vs the manual named score)
- `test_fused_ce` — **PASS** (loss diff 0.0, max grad diff 4.10e-08)
- `test_smoke_loss_decreases` — **PASS** (5.5644 → 5.5405 over 12 steps)
- `test_generate_smoke` — **PASS** (greedy, 4 tokens, in-vocab)

Guard: `.venv/bin/python -m v13_sempty.check_torch_layout` — **clean**
("named end to end outside declared boundaries").

Train smoke: `.venv/bin/python -m v13_sempty.train --preset tiny --dataset
synthetic --steps 8 --device cpu` — loss 5.5556 → 5.5409, finite, decreasing.
